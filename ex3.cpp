- Implement a producer-consumer scenario using threads, mutexes, and condition variables.
- One thread (the producer) should generate numbers and place them in a shared queue.
- Another thread (the consumer) should read numbers from the queue and print them.
- Use std::condition_variable to synchronize the producer and consumer.
